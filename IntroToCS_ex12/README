I spoke with Nadav Weisler about this exercise.
==================
=  Description:  =
==================
The design idea inspired by "A Tale of Five Balloons" the colors and the names
are all taken from the the story.

We'll explain the files and classes division:

four_in_a_row - Here everything happens. All the classes are combined to the
game. There is no special class in this file.

game - All the brain of the game is written here in a sleek class. The players
can play and change the board as they go.

player - The logic behind single player packed into a class. This player fits
not just for a manual player - but also an ai. The type of the player is
defined by a default boolean parameter.

ai - Here the magic happens. Algorithm will calculate the next move and the
ideal player created. But don't worry - You can still control the level of the
difficulty. You can deal with level 1 - but in level 3, the computer will beat
the you in no time.

screen_gui - What you see what you are in the game? Everything is written right
here. All the screen GUI is gathered into a class.

menu_gui - Before you can take a game, you should set the game as you want - Do
 you have friend to play with? Or, for example, you want play challenging game
 against the computer? Here is the GUI for the entrance for the game.

There is detailed documentation in the code for every function.
